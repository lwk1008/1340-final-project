Task 2
Q1 
(a) is unbalanced, for node 8, height of left subtree is 3, right subtree is 1, difference is 2
(c) is unbalanced, for node 9, height of left subtree is 0, right subtree is 2, difference is 2
when the differnce of height is not in the range of [-1,1],the tree is unbalanced

Q2
Yes it is not balanced, for node 10, height of left subtree is 0, right subtree is 2, differnce is 2
when the differnce of height is not in the range of [-1,1],the tree is unbalanced

Q3
To perform the task, i will put the methods to perform for each case of insert and delete for all 4 left left, left right, right right, right left case
all method will first check the balance factor then if the balance factor is not in the range [-1,1]
it will check the type of method need to be performed.
For the case now, 
a double rotation need to be performed, first a right rotation will perform on node 14, to exchange with node 13,
then a left rotation will be performed on node 13 with node 10
a right-left rotation will be performed
